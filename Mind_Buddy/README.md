# Mind-Buddy: Digital Mental Health and Psychological Support System for Students in Higher Education

## Project info : 

Mental health issues among college students have significantly increased in recent years, including anxiety, depression, burnout, sleep disorders, academic stress, and social isolation. However, there is a major gap in the availability, accessibility, and stigma-free delivery of mental health support in most higher education institutions, especially in rural and semi-urban colleges.

# Proposed Technological Challenge:
Develop a Digital Psychological Intervention System (web-based and/or mobile app) with the following capabilities:
1. AI-guided First-Aid Support: Interactive chat box that offers coping strategies and refers students to professionals when needed.
2. Confidential Booking System: For appointment with on-campus counsellor or mental health helpline.
3. Psychoeducational Resource Hub: Videos, relaxation audio, mental wellness guides in regional languages.
4. Peer Support Platform: Moderated peer-to-peer support forum with trained student volunteers.
5. Admin Dashboard: Anonymous data analytics for authorities to recognize trends and plan interventions.
